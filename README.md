# 👋 Hi, I'm **Philippe Khalil**!

### 🚀 **Web & Mobile Developer**

Second-semester university student, I have gained solid experience through various academic and personal projects, as well as during my most recent CEGEP internship, where I worked on the development of mobile applications using Flutter and Dart, with a strong focus on simplicity, efficiency, and user experience.

I have also contributed to the integration of APIs in web applications and to the optimization of front-end and back-end code in order to improve overall performance. Detail-oriented, curious, and passionate about technology, I have developed strong foundations in HTML, CSS, C#, Java, PHP, Python, Kotlin, and Dart, along with experience using technologies and frameworks such as MySQL, Django, Spring, Git, .NET, React, Flutter, and REST APIs.

Fluent in French and English, I communicate effectively within diverse teams. I am seeking an opportunity to complete my first university internship, where I can contribute to real-world projects, further develop my technical skills, and grow in an innovative environment.
